# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management System

A blockchain-enabled supply chain management (SCM) system designed to improve transparency, traceability, and data integrity across the supply chain lifecycle.

This project demonstrates how blockchain concepts can be applied to track products, transactions, and stakeholders in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Traditional supply chain systems suffer from:
- Lack of transparency between stakeholders  
- Data tampering and trust issues  
- Inefficient tracking of product movement  
- Centralized control and single points of failure  

This project explores how **blockchain technology** can address these challenges.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- Immutable record of supply chain transactions  
- Transparent product tracking across stages  
- Decentralized data storage using blockchain principles  
- Secure and verifiable transaction history  
- Reduced dependency on centralized intermediaries  

---

## 🧱 System Overview
The system models a supply chain where:
- Each transaction is recorded as a block  
- Blocks are cryptographically linked  
- Participants can verify data integrity independently  

This ensures trust and traceability without relying on a central authority.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Blockchain Concepts** – distributed ledger, hashing, immutability  
- **Smart Contract Logic** – transaction validation and state updates  
- **Programming Language:**  JavaScript / Solidity  
- **Development Tools:** React

## ▶️ How to Run / Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prabhavmishra/scm_blkchn.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd scm_blkchn
Follow the instructions in the source files or documentation to simulate supply chain transactions.

(This project focuses on concept demonstration rather than production deployment.)
